    "1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.\n",

    "2. What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "-->\n",
    "    String is a data type and a variable is in which we can store values of different data types, the value of the variable\n",
    "    can be changed throughout the program.\n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "    String --> \"string\"\n",

    "    1.Integer(a whole number (not a fractional number) that can be positive, negative, or zero)\n",

    "\n",
    "5.This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?\n",
    "-->\n",
    "    An expression is something that can be reduced to a value, for example \"1+3\" is an expression, but \"spam = 10\" is not. \n",
    "    If it doesn't work, it's a statement, if it does, it's an expression. as it cannot be reduced to a value\n",

    "8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "-->\n",

    "9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?\n",

    "10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?\n",
    "'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'\n",
    "-->\n",
    "    The expression causes an error because 99 is an integer, and only strings can be concatenated to other strings \n",
    "    with the + operator.The correct way is I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos\n",
